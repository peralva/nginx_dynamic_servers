Nginx Dynamic Servers

Nginx Dynamic Servers is a service that changes a configuration file dynamically according to which servers are online at that time for use in Nginx.

Note: The "nginx_file.bin" parameter is used to automatically reload nginx. If the same is defined, to work, this service must be running with the same nginx user.
